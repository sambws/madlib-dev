{"name":"MADLIB","tagline":"i have no idea what this is","body":"### MADLIB\r\nMadlib is an in-development kit that has built-in shorthand functions for Love2D, and uses Moonscript as it's language of choice to make code pretty and simple.\r\n\r\n### API\r\nMadlib, in basic terms, is a Lua table with a bunch of useful functions inside. Some of them, such as the gamepad portion of the library, are simply wrapper functions designed to make writing out gamepad functionality in your code easier and more fluid. Others, such as the entity system, is a multitude of functions designed for an easy and lightweight object-oriented entity system. See the REFERENCE portion of this site for more information on the functionality of Madlib.\r\n\r\n### REFERENCE\r\nThis portion of the site is dedicated to running through the functions of Madlib, and will serve as it's official documentation.  \r\n\r\n#ENTITIES\r\n\r\nThe ```Entity``` class is the base class that all game objects should extend. For now, it ships with automatic positioning and z-ordering functions in it's step and initialize functions, but will most likely be fleshed out in the future. Use Moonscript's ```super``` function to utilize the Entity class to it's fullest extent.  \r\n\r\n```addEnt(entity)``` is a function used to create entities and add them to the ```ents``` table, thus rendering and updating it. The only argument it takes is used to define the entity you wish to create.  \r\nExample: ```addEnt(Box(32, 64))``` would add a new Box entity at an x position of 32 and a y position of 64, if it's entity ```super``` is set up properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
